# Sandwich Club Project

## Project Overview
In this project, the **Sandwich Club** app shows
the details of each sandwich once it is selected.

## Why this Project

Building a layout and populating its fields from data received as JSON
is a common task for Android Developers. Although JSON parsing is usually
done using libraries, writing the JSON parsing for  this project will
help you to better understand how it is processed.

## Goal

Design the layout for the detail activity so the different elements
display in a sensible way. Implement the JSON parsing in JsonUtils so it
produces a Sandwich Object that can be used to populate the UI that you designed.
